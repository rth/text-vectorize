NLP in Rust with Python bindings

This package aims to provide a high performance toolkit for ingesting textual data for
machine learning applications.

The API is currently unstable.

Features
--------

 - Tokenization: Regexp tokenizer, Unicode segmentation + language specific rules
 - Stemming: Snowball (in Python 15-20x faster than NLTK)
 - Analyzers (*planned*): word and character n-grams, skip grams
 - Token counting: converting token counts to sparse matrices for use
   in machine learning libraries. Similar to `CountVectorizer` and
   `HashingVectorizer` in scikit-learn.
 - Feature weighting (*planned*): feature weighting based on document
   frequency (TF-IDF), feature normalization.
 - String similarity: SÃ¸rensen-Dice, Jaro
